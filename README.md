# Shane's Dotfiles

**Warning**: Running `install.sh` will overwrite any existing configurations that clash with mine. 
I would **not recommend** using this script on your system.

## The install script looks weird

This is because it's autogenerated by the script in `bin/dotify`. The `z=1` nonsense is just to make the symlinks sort below the mkdir calls.
## Why does this exist?

Mostly so I can easily transfer my most updated configurations between multiple computers / back them up.
Also so any curious people can share / steal from them.

There are a couple of random user scripts I've written in the `bin` folder that others might find useful.
